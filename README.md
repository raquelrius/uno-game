### Small simulation of UNO game
The aim of this little project is to practice with the classes and objects of javascript.
It consists of a UnoGame.mjs file where the necessary classes to play the UNO game are available and a index.js file to show an example game where those classes and methods are used.

To run the example at index.js, run:

`node index.js`
